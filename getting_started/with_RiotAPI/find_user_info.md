## 1. Finding Your Riot Username and TagLine

Riot uses a username + tagline format across their games. This is the combination that identifies your Riot ID globally (e.g., Username#Tagline).

### In-Game
- Open your League of Legends client
- Go to your profile
- Youâ€™ll see your Riot ID displayed there in the format `Username#Tagline`.

### Account Settings (via Web)
- Visit [Riot's account page](https://account.riotgames.com/).
- Log in with your credentials
- Your Riot ID will be displayed in the settings of your account
